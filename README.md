# roq-issues

This is the GitHub repository for managing all software products offered by
Roq Trading Solutions.

* Issues will be linked from the CHANGELOG's you can find published on the
  [website](https://roq-trading.com/docs/releases/).
* Each open issue will have an assigned priority.
  Please reach out if you feel the issue needs a higher priority.
* You will not be able to comment on the issues for commercial reasons.
  Please reach out if you feel an issue needs further input.
  We will discuss with you and adjust accordingly if your suggestion fits with
  the strategy of the product.
* Changes will first be pushed to the unstable channel (Conda).
  (You should monitor the [Telegram](https://t.me/roq_trading) chat for important
  notices with regards to the status of the unstable channel.)
